    `In order to let your tattoo heal properly, it's crucial to follow this guide, as ignoring it will affect the final result
and may be harmful to your health.`,
    `The healing process starts as soon as the tattoo is finished. It takes around 2 to 3 weeks & in this stage
the responsibility passes from the tattoo artist to the tattooed. Treatment of the tattoo during
the first days of healing will define how it will look for the rest of your life, so you must take great care during
the healing process!`,
    `When the tattoo is finished, a protective film is placed on top of it. This film must be removed between 2 to
12 hours. The purpose of the film is to protect the area and make the skin less irritated. After removing
the film, the tattoo should be washed gently with cool water and pH-neutral soap. Always wash your hands
with soap before touching the tattoo! The tattoo must be washed twice a day for the first 15 days.`,
    `Apply a thin layer of moisturizing cream 2 to 3 times a day. Wash the area beforehand and dry it with a paper towel.
Always maintain a good hand hygiene! Use only cream advised by your tattoo artist. Exaggerating the
amount of cream will not accelerate the healing process & it may in turn ruin your tattoo.`,
    `During the healing process it's normal for the tattoo to look dry and the skin to peel. Let it peel off
naturally without scratching or plucking your skin. The skin might feel extremely itchy, however do not
scratch it in any way. Using moisturizing cream will greatly reduce itchiness of the skin.`,
    `Avoid doing any physical exercises in the first 14 days after taking the tattoo. Wear loose and comfortable clothing that don't
 rub the tattoo aggressively or make you sweat. During the first 14 days going to the beach, swimming in
lakes or pools, Jacuzzis, sauna and solarium is strictly prohibited! A tattoo is an open wound, so it's
 vulnerable to bacterial infection. Ignoring these restrictions will compromise your tattoo and put
your health at risk.`,
    `Do not expose your tattoo to the sun. The tattooed skin is very sensitive to the sun and its UV rays
during the healing process as well as for the rest of its life. After the skin is healed, you should use
sunblock (FP50) whenever exposing your tattoo to the sun. This will ensure that the quality of the tattoo
is preserved and your skin is protected.`,
    `IMPORTANT: It is vital not to follow the opinions of third parties. Follow your tattoo artist's
guidelines. If you have any problems, always contact your tattoo artist. Your tattoo artist is not liable for
differentiated treatment taken without following our recommended guidelines! Complying with all the rules guarantees the
perfect healing & quality of your tattoo.`
